ARM CPU Power domains

The device tree allows describing of CPU power domains in a SoC. In ARM SoC,
CPUs may be grouped as clusters. A cluster may have CPUs, GIC, Coresight,
caches, VFP and power controller and other peripheral hardware. Generally,
when the CPUs in the cluster are idle/suspended, the shared resources may also
be suspended and resumed before any of the CPUs resume execution.

CPUs are the defined as the PM domain consumers and there is a PM domain
provider for the CPUs. Bindings for generic PM domains (genpd) is described in
[1].

The ARM CPU PM domain follows the same binding convention as any generic PM
domain. Additional binding properties are -

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Must also have
			"arm,pd"
		inorder to initialize the genpd provider as ARM CPU PM domain.
